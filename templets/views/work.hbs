    <h1> Online Voting System </h1>
    <p> What is an online voting system?
        An online voting system is a software platform that allows groups to securely 
        conduct votes and elections. High-quality online voting systems balance ballot 
        security, accessibility,and the overall requirements of an organization's voting event.</p>

        <h1>What’s the purpose of an online voting system?</h1>
 

           <p>Online voting tools and online election voting systems help you make important decisions by gathering the input of your group in a way that’s systematic and verifiable.
            
            Oftentimes, these decisions are made on a yearly basis - during an event (e.g. your organization’s AGM) or at a particular time of the year. Or you might run ongoing polls amongst your group (e.g. anonymous employee feedback surveys).
            
            It’s a good idea to use an online voting system to:
            
            Elect your leadership: A board of directors election is a good example, where there are multiple positions (e.g. chair, vice president, secretary, treasurer). All of which may include supporting documentation (e.g. biographies, resumés, headshots).
            
            Admit new members to your group. This helps you stick to a regular, fair process of evaluation and lets candidates know what to expect.
            
            Gather anonymous feedback from your employees. Managers (and managers of managers) want to know how their employees truly feel about their jobs and work life. Using an online voting system with a capacity for secret balloting helps employees express their true feelings, by understanding and trusting that their feedback will be heard, but not tied directly to them.
            
            Vote on yearly budgets. And since adjustments to your budget are often needed, an online voting system will keep voting secure and accessible - no matter where the members of your group may happen to be.
            
            Alter your operational procedures and bylaws. Just like leadership elections, expect group members to react strongly toward changes - no matter how minor - to organizational processes. You’ll want to collect individual responses to these changes in a systematic manner.
